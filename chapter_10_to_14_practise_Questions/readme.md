1.	var city = "Karachi" if (city = "Karachi") { console.log("The City OF Lights") Correct the above statement: 
Also try this statement by yourself 

2.	This is the first line of an if statement: 
if (x === y) { 
Complete the statement. If the condition is true, display a box that asks the user value of z? and assign it to another variable. 

3.	Code an if statement that tests if ZipCode is "10010" so, Alert that "Karachi". if not then alert ("Please write correct city") 

4.	Code an if statement. Test whether a variable has a particular numerical value. If so, assign a new value to that variable, as in x = 1; 

                            Chapter 11 (Comparison Operators) 

1.	Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether one variable is unequal to another. (Use !) 

2.	Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether the value represented by a variable is greater than or equal to the value represented by another variable. 

3.	Code an if statement. Test whether a variable is unequal to a particular number. If so, assign a number to that variable. 

4.	Code an if statement that tests whether a number is unequal to a different number. If the condition is true (it will be), display a congratulations alert. 

5.	Code a prompt asking for your first name. 
Code an if statement that tests whether the name you entered is unequal to another name. 
If the condition is true (it will be), display an alert that says "No match" 

                          Chapter 12 (if…else and else if statements) 

1.	Code an if statement that tests whether the value represented by a variable is greater than or equal to the value represented by another variable. If so, display an alert. If not, display a different alert. 

2.	Write a program using if else and else if statement which take marks from user. And the program will calculate your percentage and  give you grade A/C to Your percentage. (MARKSHEET) 
3.	This is the if statement that begins the code. 
if (a === 10) {   alert("a is 10"); 
} 
If a isn't 10, display an alert that says The correct value of a is 
Note: Try this by yourself 

4.	Prompt the user to enter a city. 
If the city is Karachi, display an alert acknowledging it is Karachi. 
If not, check to see if it's Lahore. 
If it is, display an alert acknowledging it's Lahore. 
Otherwise, display a different alert. 


                            Chapter 13 (Testing sets of conditions) 
1.	Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether both are true: a has the same value as b and c has the same value as d. 

2.	Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether either or both are true: a has the same value as b or c doesn't have the same value as d. 

3.	Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether  I. 	name is either "Hamza" or "Arsalan". II. 	age is Less than 60. 

4.	Declare two variables and assign them number values. 
If the first variable is less than the second variable or greater than the second variable, display an alert. 

5.	Declare 2 variables. Assign one of them your first name and the other one your last name. 
Code 2 prompts, asking for your first and your last name. 
If your answers match the two variables, display an alert. 

                            Chapter 14 (If statements nested) 

1.	Code an if statement enclosing a nested if. If password is not empty, then check if password is not greater than 5  , then display an alert that says "Password must be greater than 5" if greater than 5 then Alert "OK". 

2.	Try this statement by yourself if (a === 1) {  if (c === "Max") {     alert("OK"); 
  } 
} 

3.	Code the first line of an if statement that avoids the nesting above by testing for multiple conditions. 
if (a === 1) {   if (c === "Max") {  alert("OK"); 
  } } 

4.	Declare two variables and assign them the same number value. Test two conditions, using nested if statements. Test whether the first variable equals the second variable and also whether it is less than or equal to the second variable. If the test passes—and it will—display an alert message.
